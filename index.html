        <h1>McDonalds Visualisation</h1>
        <p>By Dominic Lai</p>
        <br>
        <p>McDonalds is one of the largest fast food chains in the world with an unparalleled presence in everyoneâ€™s lives. Originating from America in 1940, the simple burger joint rapidly grew across the globe creating an empire with its signature food item - the Big Mac. If we were to create a franchise to beat McDonalds, we will first have to look into the Big Mac.</p>

      <div class="pure-u-1-1">
        <p align="center"><b>Pick Your Price </b></p>
        <p align="center">One way to do this is to make it more affordable! Below is a map of the price of the Big Mac Around the world. If our franchise is able to produce a signature item that is cheaper than the Big Mac, it would have a competitive advantage.</p>

      <div class="pure-u-1-1">
        <p align="center"><b>Pick Your Menu </b></p>
        <p align="center">Another idea is to make it more healthy! McDonalds is known for being one of the unhealthiest meals one could consume, and the Big Mac is no exception. Below is the composition of the Big Mac. If we are able to make a burger which contains less fat and cholesterol it would be a great advantage.s</p>
        <div id="vis4" class="vis-container"></div>

      <div class="pure-u-1-1">
        <p align="center">But why stop there - McDonalds has plenty of items on its menu. One easy way to see the trend of all items of McDonalds is to compare its calories to fat ratio. Thus we could also create menu items that sit below it - making our customers have more calories and less fat - how enticing!</p>
        <br>
        <p align="center">If we want to beat a specific category - there is a filter option on the graph available so we can really focus on beating each food group.</p>
        <div id="vis2" class="vis-container"></div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <!-- end pure grid group -->
    <div class="pure-g">
      <div class="pure-u-1-1">
        <p align="center"><b>Pick Your Location </b></p>
        <p align="center">Unfortunately it would be hard to beat McDonalds when there is a giant yellow M around every corner. Thus we need to be mindful of the countries which have a high McDonald's restaurant to citizen ratio. Below are the top 5 countries which do so. Any countries other than these listed are suitable for establishing a new franchise (for now).</p>
        <div id="vis3" class="vis-container"></div>
      </div>

    <!-- pure grid group -->
    <div class="pure-g">
      <div class="pure-u-1-1">
        <p align="center"><b> Pick Your Goal </b></p>
        <p align="center">So - we have a place to start, and we know how to make a good menu - how do we know if we beat McDonalds? Money.</p>
        <br>
        <p align="center">Fast food is a highly profitable business, but to say we beat the giants is to join them in their large revenue pool. The last graph will show us how much money we need to make in order to be considered a top fast food restaurant - where McDonalds has made 23.2 Billion Dollars. Click the graph to change the moving average black line if you want to exclude some lower restaurants from the calculations - since they are just that irrelevant. ;) </p>
        <div id="vis5" class="vis-container"></div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p align="center">So again - How can we beat the Big Yellow M? First, create a better menu. Two, pick a good location to start the first restaurant. Three, make 23.2 Billion Dollars. I hope your endeavors are fruitful! :)  </p>
